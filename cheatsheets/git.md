Add editor configurations

Let's configure the editor to VS code (already installed in labs), run the following in the command line:

git config --global core.editor "code --wait"

or if you prefer to use notedpad on Windows, run the following command:
git config --global core.editor "notepad"

on macOS, use the following command:
git config --global core.editor "open -e -W -n"
